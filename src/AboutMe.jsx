    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p>
    My career has evolved from video and lighting manufacturing into the exciting world of software development. After spending five years in the video tech industry, I discovered a deep passion for solving complex problems—and soon realized that software development was where I could make the most impact. I transitioned from enhancing hardware products to writing code, and I’ve been focused on honing my skills ever since.

Here’s what I bring to the table in software development:

Languages & Frameworks:

  • Ruby & Rails

  • JavaScript (including ES6+)

  •HTML/CSS (Responsive Design)

  •APIs and RESTful Services

Real-World Projects:

  • Built a Gym Fitness App during my coding bootcamp, integrating features like user authentication, workout tracking, and progress dashboards.
  
• Worked on projects using Git, version control, and Agile methodologies, delivering on both team and individual tasks.

Problem-Solving & Debugging:

  •Applying a strong foundation of critical thinking and troubleshooting to write clean, efficient code that meets user needs.
  • Debugging and optimizing software for performance improvements, with a focus on scalability and maintainability.
 
Collaborative Development:

  •Experienced in working with teams to build and deploy full-stack applications.

  •Passionate about pair programming, sharing knowledge, and contributing to a culture of continuous learning.

My experience in video technology strengthened my problem-solving abilities and gave me an appreciation for user-centric design. These skills are now being applied directly to software development, where I’m focused on building high-quality, scalable applications.

I’m eager to fully immerse myself in a software development role, where I can continue to grow, enhance my skills, and make meaningful contributions through coding. Whether refining existing products or building new ones from the ground up, I’m excited to leverage my technical expertise to create impactful solutions and drive success in my projects.
